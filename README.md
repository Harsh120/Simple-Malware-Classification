Malware image classification by Java (No ML)

This is basic classification to learn how malware image classification works.

1) FiletoBinary.java converts the file (file_to_check.txt) into binary. file_to_check.txt file contains data to check for malware.

2) Image.java take input as a binary number that we got in above step and make and save an image of that file.

3) Comparison.java compare above generated png file with all other png and show if file is malware or not.

NOTE: All data are random data
